Job Title: Odoo developer

Job Description:
We are considering deploying Odoo in our company and I am in the process of exploring it. 
We have an internal software development team for our own products but have no experience with Odoo. 
But we know Python and ChatGPT is pretty good at Odoo ;

I am interested to form a relationship with an experienced Odoo developer who
 can help us with various tasks. We don't want to create future footguns for ourselves. 
 We also sometimes simply need advice on how Odoo functionality works.

Key Requirements:
- Put all customizations in modules rather than using Studio
- Work will be adhoc and ongoing
- Need guidance on Odoo best practices and functionality

To apply: Please write a few lines on how you usually structure modifications 
in Odoo (ie. use of Studio, everything as modules, Git, Odoo.sh etc.). Convince me you know what you are doing with Odoo.
